                            Kirk Franklin has been recently trending in the International Christian music scene. Franklin was performing at a B.E.T rap show for the 2022 Hip-hop Awards.

                            Today is our 10th year marriage anniversary! Ten years ago on the 1st of September 2012, we stood on the green lawns of Brackenhurst in Tigoni and exchanged our vows.
